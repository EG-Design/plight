        <!--Zeron-->
        <h1 class="xl-text" id="zeron">ZERON</h1>
        <p>
          Zeron, generally refers to the universe as a whole. Zeron itself is
          poorly estmated to be ~10000 years old, only the last 1-2 thousand
          years are "properly" recorded. In current times there are three
          factions battling over planets and resources (MV, Advanced
          Corporations and Kal Agency). Each faction seeks power but does not
          want to overextend and let one of their rivals strike them when they
          are weak.
        </p>

        <!--Rhune-->
        <h1 class="xl-text" id="rhune">RHUNE</h1>
        <p>
          If Zeron is the crust of the planet, Rhune is the mantle. The nervous
          system under the skin. Rhune is considered a myth or legend to most. A
          concept of an idea of which most never take into account, never taking
          the time to consider the reality which lies just beneath their feet.
        </p>
        <!--Factions-->
        <h1 class="xl-text" id="factions">FACTIONS</h1>
        <h2 class="l-text">Alomori</h2>
        <p>
          Alomori seek to help the less fortunate, they are a peaceful faction
          mainly consisting of Fayrish they set up encampments surrounding the
          outskirts battlefields, taking in those who will not be able fight
          again. They don't do such deeds out of kindness, but rather to
          experiment with new medical techniques and tests, some which go less
          than ideal, seeing a Alomori member could mean rescue or a fate worse
          than death.
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Advanced Corporations</h2>
        <p>
          Advanced Corporations, one of the three rivaling factions. Advanced is
          the most formal of the three, have a sleek blue and silver uniform and
          standard battle vehicles.
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Eevee</h2>
        <p>
          Eevee, a universe superpower that fought against three factions at
          once, finally taken down by the might of the Eiraditch army they had
          technologies beyond anything ever seen. Have legions of soldiers armed
          with ENGR weapons, Heavy star fighters and frigates, along with long
          range scanners made their attacks devastating and unpredictable.
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Eiraditch Syndicate</h2>
        <p>
          The Eiraditch are a force none can stand against. Eiraditch
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Hipyr</h2>
        <p>
          Hipyr, an undercover organization that used to fuel eevee's armada.
          They now support Advanced Corporations, or so it seems. Hipyr has some
          of the greatest minds in the industry and even though the
          organization's size itself may be underwhelming their strange tech has
          proven a great threat against those who seek to uncover them.

        <!--Tech-->
        <h1 class="xl-text" id="tech">TECH</h1>
        <h2 class="l-text">ENG/Crystals</h2>
        <p>
          "Energy" or ENG is a strange substance made from giant crystals
          commonly found in vast caves on moons and deep under some planets.
          It's properties make it suitable for a weapon propellent, fuel for
          both land vehicles and starcraft, explosives, it can harden metal
          alloys to a great degree and can be converted into power without much
          loss. However it comes at a cost, as it saps magic users greatly for
          unknown reasons.
        </p>

        <h2 class="l-text">Star cores</h2>
        <p>
          In the depths of space there are orbs of powerful energy, that differs
          from the energy found in the crystals. Star cores come in a few sizes
          and colors: White when very small, light blue, the blue and then a
          dark blue followed by black when they implode. Since they last for
          thousands of years the implosions are not much of an issue. They power
          the star frigates, but can be used to power machinery and even
          weapons, since they are so rare it is not feasible for most to use
          them this way.
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Powder and Gas</h2>
        <p>
          Gunpowder and Gas are rarer substances in Zeron, not because they are
          hard to make, but since the ENG mines and factories were founded few
          try to make these lesser used (and less efficient) materials. Magic
          users do use powder weapons, most notably the Antyshoal field
          "medics".
        </p>
        <!--Races-->
        <h1 class="xl-text" id="races">RACES</h1>
        <h2 class="l-text">Fayrish</h2>
        <p>
          Bird/moth-like “fairies” that use bio-tech and wear mask similar to
          plague doctors. Very good and healing stuff but all are born ill with
          an incurable disease.
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Aeri</h2>
        <p>
          Giant wolves wielding giant swords. Mostly all primitive and tribal
          but there are a few in civilization.
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Silmari</h2>
        <p>
          Aquatic but able to breath on land. Silmari have shells for heads that
          they pass down for generations. They have steam powered tech powered
          from underwater vents.
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Yarian</h2>
        <p>
          Lizard folk. Very susceptible to diseases they prefer to stay away
          From all other races other than Fayrish. They have large castles and
          medieval weapons.
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Eiradicth</h2>
        <p>
          Human like apart from digitigrade legs and odd gemlike eyes, Eiraditch
          are almost indestructible and are huge in numbers. They thrive from
          war but are still recovering from the last. They use meele polearms, a
          ranged weapon is shameful.
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Antyshoal</h2>
        <p>
          Black fur and canine-like. In the top three most common races. They
          wear strange white masks and rarely (if ever) expose there faces.
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Veodian</h2>
        <p>
          Cyborg lizards. They are rising in power but still little in number,
          not much is known of them by other races. They have star core tech
          along with sonic weapons.
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Coromoth</h2>
        <p>
          Triangle headed “robots” created by the Eiraditch. Heard to have
          organic wiring, and much more sentient than any other robot thus why
          they are deemed a race.
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Human</h2>
        <p>
          Somehow found there way into Zeron, now they are one of the most
          common races, and by far the most common in cities. Most humans in
          Zeron focus on tech, but there are a few who study magic.
