        <!--Zeron-->
        <h1 class="xl-text" id="zeron">ZERON</h1>
        <p>
          Zeron, generally refers to the universe as a whole. Zeron itself is
          poorly estimated to be ~10000 years old, only the last 1-2 thousand
          years are "properly" recorded. In current times there are three
          factions battling over planets and resources (MV, Advanced
          Corporations and Kal Agency). Each faction seeks power but does not
          want to overextend and let one of their rivals strike them when they
          are weak. Star craft exist but small craft are not reliable for
          interstellar travel. There is a miracle energy extracted from crystals
          (ENG), it is what powers most technology, but it sap all magic for
          unknown reasons.
        </p>

        <!--Rhune-->
        <h1 class="xl-text" id="rhune">RHUNE</h1>
        <p>
          Rhune is the mantle, a nervous system. Rhune itself is barely spoken
          about, and even then it is considered a myth or legend. An idea of
          which most never take the time to consider which the reality that lies
          beneath their feet. "Rhunes" refer to the a scripting language used in
          magic, it can be written, spoken, etched into material, even played
          into eerie songs with music. The curious thing is that even those who
          know how to use Rhunes don't understand what they mean, Rhunes seem to
          change and warp even as one uses them.
        </p>
        <!--Factions-->
        <h1 class="xl-text" id="factions">FACTIONS</h1>
        <h2 class="l-text">Alomori</h2>
        <p>
          Alomori seek to help the less fortunate, they are a "peaceful" faction
          mainly consisting of Fayrish they set up encampments surrounding the
          outskirts battlefields, treating wounded who run from battle, or left
          behind. They don't do such deeds out of kindness, but rather to
          experiment with new medical techniques and tests, some which go less
          than ideal, seeing a Alomori member could mean rescue and healing or a
          fate worse than you would find on the battlefield.
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Advanced Corporations</h2>
        <p>
          Advanced Corporations, one of the three rivaling factions. Advanced is
          the most formal of the three, have a sleek blue and silver uniforms,
          standard battle vehicles, and powerful sets of armor. Most of Advanced
          are human.
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Eevee</h2>
        <p>
          Eevee, a superpower that fought against three factions at once,
          finally taken down by the might of the Eiraditch army they had
          technologies beyond anything ever seen. Having legions of soldiers
          armed with ENGR weapons, heavy star fighters and frigates, along with
          long range scanners made their attacks devastating and unpredictable.
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Eiraditch Syndicate</h2>
        <p>
          All Eiraditch are members of the Eiraditch Syndicate, it being a
          syndicate the faction is not a large organization but rather it
          assembles when needed. Even though they are still recovering from the
          war with Eevee they still pose the greatest threat in Zeron.
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Hipyr</h2>
        <p>
          Hipyr, an undercover organization that used to fuel eevee's armada.
          They now support Advanced Corporations, or so it seems. Hipyr has some
          of the greatest minds in the industry and even though the
          organization's size itself may be underwhelming their strange tech has
          proven a great threat against those who seek to uncover them.
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Kal Agency</h2>
        <p>
          Kal Agency, one of the three rivaling factions mostly consisting of
          Antyshoal. Unlike the others Kal Agency does not use ENG stims,
          instead, their field "medics" use pages from spellbooks to repair
          battle damage. Their use of orange magic has proven devastating in war
          and impressive in industry.
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Knights of Kerauno</h2>
        <p>
          The Knights of Kerauno is a Veodian faction. Mostly unheard of but
          rising in power quickly, Veodians are still quite new to Zeron but
          their focus on star core based tech has created unique powerful
          technologies and sonic weapons. Since star cores are so rare most
          could not sustain such tech, but the Knights of Kerauno are based of a
          galaxy on the rim of Zeron, where star cores are more common.
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Maltech Vestus</h2>
        <p>
          MV or Maltech Vestus, one of the three rivaling factions. MV is a
          conglomeration of different races, magic users and tech alike the only
          way to recognize members are their welding mask like helmets, yet that
          is not a sure sign.
        </p>
        <!--Magic-->
        <h1 class="xl-text" id="magic">MAGIC</h1>
        <h2 class="l-text">Red</h2>
        <p>
          Text based / Needs: blood into rhunes / Affects: rage / Use: empower,
          activations, potions. Red magic is arguably the most powerful of the
          seven, it's uses are vast and non-limiting, however it is the most
          researched. Aeri are the users of red magic.
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Orange</h2>
        <p>
          Material based / Needs: rhune text into flesh pages/books / Affects:
          greed / Use: prosthetic limbs, creatures and constructs. Used by
          Antyshoal, it comes in handy on the battlefield but it can be used for
          sabotage and infiltration.
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Yellow</h2>
        <p>
          Material based / Needs: tissue into rhunes / Affects: sickness / Use:
          healing/biotech. The best healing magic, yellow magic is used by the
          Fayrish. Capable of healing sickness and disease but not able to
          repair much tissue. It is performed with a Rhune etched stamp and
          bio-organic paste, often applied to the back and leaving a "scar" that
          reflects the Rhune and the size of the stamp.
        </p>

          <!--Hello there code wanderer, curious to see you here, Well I suppose
          it would be rude not to give you anything in return for your troubles.
          Rhune based / Needs: Thoughts / Affects: mutations / Use: creation of
          sentient entities. Oh, that's all your getting, don't be foolish and
          assume I would spoil everything.-->
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Blue</h2>
        <p>
          Auditory based / Needs: sound from rhune music / Affects:
          disconnection of mind and body / Use: hypnosis and illusions. Used by
          the Silmari, it is often considered a more powerful version of indigo.
          It is performed with instruments, which can be as small as a pair of
          chimes to a grand organ. Blue magic can even be cast from a music box,
          meaning complex deadly traps and spells can be triggered with a simple
          tripwire.
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Indigo</h2>
        <p>
          Auditory based / Needs: water and voice / Affects: change of culture /
          Use: disguises. Used by both Veodians and Silmari, indigo magic is
          used for disguising oneself and altering appearances, which ranges
          from small additions to appearing as an object such as a box or even
          invisibly. It requires a spoken code to maintain and uses a water
          sphere to contain the figure and alter light sources. Note the
          disguises do not transform the physical figure in any way.
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Violet</h2>
        <p>
          Text based / Needs: banner with rhunes / Affects: doubt, anxiety /
          Use: speed, power, agility. Rarely used, the Veodians are the main
          users of violet magic. Notably used on their fearsome war mechs giving
          them incomprehensible speed for something their size. It is written on
          banners, capes, tapestries, etc. The strength of the spell is based of
          the power of the rhune script and integrity of banner.
        </p>
        <!--Tech-->
        <h1 class="xl-text" id="tech">TECH</h1>
        <h2 class="l-text">ENG/Crystals</h2>
        <p>
          "Energy" or ENG is a strange substance made from giant crystals
          commonly found in vast caves on moons and deep under some planets.
          It's properties make it suitable for a weapon propellent, fuel for
          both land vehicles and starcraft, explosives, it can harden metal
          alloys to a great degree and can be converted into power without much
          loss, it can even be used as a stimulate (although not without great
          side affects). However it comes at a cost, as it saps magic users
          greatly for unknown reasons.
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Star cores</h2>
        <p>
          In the depths of space there are orbs of powerful energy, that differs
          from the energy found in the crystals. Star cores come in a few sizes
          and colors: White when very small, light blue, the blue and then a
          dark blue followed by black when they implode. Since they last for
          thousands of years the implosions are not much of an issue. They power
          the star frigates, but can be used to power machinery and even
          weapons, since they are so rare it is not feasible for most to use
          them this way.
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Powder and Gas</h2>
        <p>
          Gunpowder and Gas are rarer substances in Zeron, not because they are
          hard to make, but since the ENG mines and factories were founded few
          try to make these lesser used (and less efficient) materials. Magic
          users do use powder weapons, most notably the Antyshoal field medics.
        </p>
        <!--Races-->
        <h1 class="xl-text" id="races">RACES</h1>
        <h2 class="l-text">Fayrish</h2>
        <p>
          Bird/moth-like “fairies” that use bio-tech and wear mask similar to
          plague doctors. Despite being skilled at healing with yellow magic,
          all are born ill with an incurable disease.
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Aeri</h2>
        <p>
          Giant wolves wielding giant swords. Primitive and tribal but there are
          a few in smaller settlements. Aeri strike fear into even the fiercest
          warriors. Their size and strength along with red magic make them near
          unstoppable in the heat of battle.
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Silmari</h2>
        <p>
          Aquatic but able to breath on land. Silmari have shells for heads that
          they pass down for generations, the shells grow larger and the spikes
          on the top that finally mature into a full circle. They have steampunk
          tech powered from underwater vents. They use blue and indigo magic.
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Yarian</h2>
        <p>
          Lizard folk. Very susceptible to diseases. Xenophobic, they prefer to
          stay away From all other races other than Fayrish. They have large
          castles and medieval weapons, occupying many large planets away from
          the core. Although Yarian may seem to have a low constitution and are
          weak physically, they make up for it by being squishy and rubbery.
          They are incredibly hard to kill in combat and often come back from
          deathly hits many times.
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Eiraditch</h2>
        <p>
          Human like apart from digitigrade legs and odd gemlike eyes, Eiraditch
          are almost indestructible and are huge in numbers. The Eiraditch are
          war driven and their culture revolves around it, but are still
          recovering from the last. They only use meele polearms, a ranged
          weapon in the hands of an Eiraditch is shameful.
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Antyshoal</h2>
        <p>
          Black fur and canine-like. In the top three most common races. They
          wear strange white masks and never expose there faces. Antyshoal have
          great libraries of spellbooks, records and literature alike.
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Veodian</h2>
        <p>
          Cyborg lizards. They are rising in power but still little in number,
          not much is known of them by other races. They have star core tech
          along with sonic weapons. They use violet and indigo magic.
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Coromoth</h2>
        <p>
          Triangle headed “robots” created by the Eiraditch for a war. Heard to
          have organic wiring, and much more sentient than any other robot thus
          why they are deemed a race. Coromoth are hive minded, they have the
          capacity to make individual decisions but all interconnected through a
          network.
        </p>
        <h2 class="l-text">Human</h2>
        <p>
          Somehow found there way into Zeron, now they are one of the most
          common races, and by far the most common in cities. Most humans in
          Zeron focus on tech, but there are a few who study magic.
